Description: An interface to the 'Open Tree of Life' API to retrieve
    phylogenetic trees, information about studies used to assemble the
    synthetic tree, and utilities to match taxonomic names to 'Open Tree
    identifiers'. The 'Open Tree of Life' aims at assembling a
    comprehensive phylogenetic tree for all named species.
